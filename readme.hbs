# imagemapper
imagemapper is both a drawing tool for making image maps and a viewer for displaying image maps.
Instantiated as an editor it adds SVG drawing capability (rectangles, circles, ellipses and polygons) on top of your image to let you make image maps.
Instantiated as a view it displays the shapes you import to it (could be exported from an editor) and supports event handlers (eg. click) performing action on that specific event and shape id.

## Install
```
$ npm install @overlapmedia/imagemapper
```

## From browser
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/overlapmedia/imagemapper@1.0.2/dist/imagemapper.min.js"></script>

    const myEditor = editor('editor-id');
    myEditor.rect();
</script>
```
